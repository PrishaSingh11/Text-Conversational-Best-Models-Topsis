## Introduction  
This document provides a detailed analysis of the TOPSIS evaluation applied to different LLMs. The TOPSIS method ranks models based on their similarity to an ideal best solution using multiple criteria.  

## Dataset and Metrics  
The dataset includes the following evaluation metrics:  

- **Perplexity (PPL)** *(Lower is better)* – Measures uncertainty in predictions; lower values indicate more confident outputs.  
- **BLEU Score** *(Higher is better)* – Evaluates text similarity between generated and reference text.  
- **ROUGE Score** *(Higher is better)* – Assesses text overlap to measure recall-based similarity.  
- **Diversity Metrics** *(Higher is better)* – Measures variation in generated outputs to prevent repetition.  
- **Latency** *(Lower is better)* – Represents response speed; lower values mean faster model performance.  
- **Memory Usage** *(Lower is better)* – Indicates resource efficiency; lower values reduce computational cost.  
- **Human Evaluation** *(Higher is better)* – Captures subjective model performance based on human judgment.  

## Key Observations  
- **MPT-30B and Llama 2** achieved the highest TOPSIS scores, making them the most balanced models across all criteria.  
- **Claude 2.1** ranks third, with a TOPSIS score of showing strong BLEU and ROUGE scores but weaker diversity and memory efficiency.  
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro** had a better balance than Claude 2.1 in human evaluation and diversity but still ranked fourth.  
- **GPT-4**, despite its high BLEU and ROUGE scores, ranks last due to a lower TOPSIS score, likely due to its higher perplexity and latency.  

## Conclusion  
- **MPT-30B and Llama 2** are the best models based on the TOPSIS evaluation, excelling in multiple key metrics.  
- **Claude 2.1 and Gemini 1.5 Pro** are mid-tier performers.  
- **GPT-4** ranks lowest, indicating that despite strong traditional NLP metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), it may not be the most optimal choice when balancing other factors like efficiency and latency.  

These insights help in selecting the best LLM for applications where multiple factors need to be considered simultaneously.
